 * with socket connection, it will first do host lookup with java.net.InetAddress#getByName
 * if it does not exist, UnknownHostException will be thrown,
 * then the `socket.connect` cannot be reached.
 * in order to make it connected, we could do replacement for
 * 1) collecting host info
 * 2) providing an ip address

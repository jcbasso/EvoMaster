            ---    do slice and remove calls after create resource endpoint call
            ---    add a DELETE with different user (verify get a 403)
            - append new REST Call action (see mutator classes) for PATCH/PUT with different auth, based
              on action copies from action definitions. should be on same endpoint.
            - need to resolve path element parameters to point to same resolved endpoint as DELETE
            - as PUT/PATCH requires payloads and possible valid query parameters, search from archive an
              existing action that returns 2xx, and copy it to use as starting point
            - execute new test case with fitness function
